# TypeScript portable JSON application

Implement the selected TypeScript Flavor as direct, auditable TypeScript for Node.js 20
or newer using built-in modules only. Unless the Component declares a role-specific
path, write the complete application to source/main.ts and put the native generated-test
implementation at source/tests/litai_test.ts. Dispatch the Standard `--litai-test` and
`--litai-smoke` modes before parsing exactly one UTF-8 JSON array containing the
application arguments from process.argv[2]; keep the test implementation independent of
source/tests/manifest.json. Validate every shape used by the specification, compute with
deterministic integer and string semantics, and write exactly one JSON result to
standard output.

Before completing generation, locate `npx` or `tsc` on `PATH` and run `tsc --noEmit`
against the generated tree, then run `node --experimental-strip-types source/main.ts
--litai-test` (or an equivalent TypeScript-capable Node invocation) directly. Repair the
implementation and generated-test protocol until that command exits successfully and
reports every selected case exactly once. Treat this as a generation-time self-check
only; do not weaken, replace, or bypass any later lifecycle phase.

Import every generated sibling module through an explicit relative specifier that
includes the file extension — `./main.ts`, `./tests/litai_test.ts` — never a bare
specifier.
