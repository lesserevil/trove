# Prompt Master for direct Literate AI tasks

This is a Literate AI adaptation of `nidhinjs/prompt-master` 1.7.0. The upstream
skill's useful invariant is retained: convert a rough request into a concise task where
every instruction is load-bearing, target-specific, scoped, and testable. Its broad
creative/media profiles and visible copy-paste output format are intentionally omitted:
this adaptation sits inside the direct coding-agent path, not a general prompt-writing
product.

## Routing boundary

Apply this skill only when **all** of these are true:

- the user is interacting directly with Literate AI or one of its supported coding
  agents;
- no MAC/task-ledger envelope identifies an already translated task; and
- the rough request must become a coding-agent task or implementation prompt.

When MAC supplies the task, do not invoke this skill. MAC uses the upstream technique
between its task and provider layers; translating again could alter scope, stop
conditions, or correlation semantics. Consume the MAC task exactly as supplied, while
keeping task/correlation IDs outside semantic generation and cache identities.

## Authority boundary

This skill can sharpen the *task envelope*. It cannot add or rewrite product behavior,
select a Flavor or model, alter an exact skill set, reorder workflow stages, broaden
filesystem/network privileges, authorize build/execution/publication, or replace the
resolved generation prompt assembled from locked authority.

The following remain authoritative, in order:

1. current Component specifications and public interfaces;
2. selected Flavor requirements;
3. exact specification-to-source skills;
4. workflow and routing policy;
5. validation, security, and execution-authorization policy.

If a user's request conflicts with those inputs, surface the conflict. Do not optimize
the conflict away.

## Translate one direct request

Silently extract these dimensions from the user request and current project evidence:

| Dimension | Required content |
| --- | --- |
| Outcome | One precise operation and target state |
| Provider | Exact coding-agent command selected by Literate AI |
| Starting state | Current project, relevant Component, current failing/passing evidence |
| Authority | Exact specs, Flavors, skills, workflow, and route the task must obey |
| Scope | Files/symbols the agent may change and explicit do-not-touch surfaces |
| Constraints | Security, dependency, compatibility, and user constraints |
| Evidence | Commands and assertions that prove completion |
| Stop conditions | Destructive, ambiguous, privilege-bearing, or authority-changing actions requiring review |
| Output | Expected edits plus concise terminal evidence |

Ask no more than three clarifying questions, and only when a required dimension cannot
be recovered from current project authority. Prefer inspecting the repository to asking
the user for facts already present there.

## Provider-aware task form

For agentic coding providers (`codex`, `claude`, `cursor-agent`, `opencode`), emit one
internal task with these sections:

```text
Outcome
Starting state and exact authority
Allowed scope
Forbidden changes
Required work
Verification
Stop and ask before
Completion report
```

Keep constraints and acceptance criteria in the first third. Name exact paths and
symbols when known. Require repository inspection before edits, implementation rather
than a proposal, and fresh verification before completion. Do not request hidden chain
of thought or fixed reasoning budgets. Never embed credentials, environment-variable
values, raw acceptance oracles, or task-ledger metadata in the provider prompt.

Provider adjustments are narrow:

- `claude`: explain why constraints exist, front-load context, and forbid unrequested
  abstractions or features.
- `codex` / OpenAI reasoning agents: use compact instructions, explicit output and
  done conditions; do not add step-by-step reasoning prompts.
- `cursor-agent`: include file/symbol anchors and a strict do-not-touch list.
- `opencode`: include exact repository scope, required tool use, verification commands,
  and stop conditions for destructive operations.

## Token-efficiency and safety audit

Before dispatch, verify:

1. Every sentence changes the provider's action or acceptance decision.
2. No instruction duplicates locked authority already attached to the request; use an
   exact identity/path reference instead of paraphrasing it.
3. The task has one outcome; split unrelated outcomes into separately authorized runs.
4. File scope, forbidden actions, evidence, and stop conditions are explicit.
5. The task does not claim task-ledger approval grants Literate AI execution privilege.
6. The result can be judged from binary evidence without a corrective re-prompt.
