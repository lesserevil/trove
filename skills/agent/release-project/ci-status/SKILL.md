# Wait for green CI

Inherits `../SKILL.md`. Wrap `litai project tracker inspect` and the
`ci_status` argv it names. Do not invent `gh` or `glab` flags. Authoring
shard YAML is `ci-test-plan`, not this skill.

## What to run

1. `litai project tracker inspect`. If `ci_status` is empty (`unsupported`
   or `ambiguous`), record a named skip. Do not treat local tests as the
   remote matrix.
2. Run the exact `ci_status` argv. GitHub lists runs for `HEAD`; GitLab
   reports pipeline status for the current checkout.
3. Fail closed on `failure`, `cancelled`, or a red pipeline. That blocks
   `litai release plan` and `land` merge.
4. Pending/in-progress is wait, not pass. Re-run the same argv; do not
   start a second CI system.

A clean local `make` target is necessary, never sufficient, for production
posture or a versioned cut.
