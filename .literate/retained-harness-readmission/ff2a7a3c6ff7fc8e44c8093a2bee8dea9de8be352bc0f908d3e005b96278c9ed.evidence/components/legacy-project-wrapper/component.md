# Legacy Project Pipeline Wrapper

This Component exposes the quarantined project's proven pipeline through the
top-level `litai.harness.mk` boundary. Proven stages (direct baseline ran) are
`build`, `test`; recorded but not executed are none; missing stages are
`package` and fail loudly rather than becoming silent no-ops.

### Requirement: Preserve the direct baseline

Every proven wrapper stage SHALL exit successfully and produce the same observed
legacy-tree identity as the corresponding direct Phase 1 baseline stage recorded in
`.literate/legacy-harness-baseline.json`. Recorded stages that were not executed
(host-heavy or missing driver) have no baseline identity to match.

#### Scenario: Wrapper stage matches direct execution

- **WHEN** a proven stage is invoked through `litai.harness.mk`
- **THEN** its exit status and resulting legacy-tree identity match the direct baseline
